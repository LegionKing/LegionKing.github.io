I have joined in the [NUS Ubicomp Lab](https://ubiquitous.comp.nus.edu.sg/) on 14 Oct. 2024 as a research fellow working with Prof. [Brian Y. Lim](https://www.brianlim.net/). I received my PhD. degree in Computer Science and Technology at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2024, advised by Prof. Enhong Chen and Prof. Qi Liu. I received my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology at USTC in 2018.

My research interests lie in deep learning, user modeling, explainable AI, and their applications for areas such as education. My current research focuses on measuring users’ abilities with cognitive diagnosis models. I introduced the data-driven strategy into traditional psychometric-based cogntive diagnosis models, and have extended this research from different aspects, including the influences of item contents, knowledge concept structures, and examinees’ context. I have also explored some other related topics in user modeling, such as interpretability, uncertainty, fairness, and cold start.

[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

<!--Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. -->
